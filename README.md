# C-Libs

#### What is C-Libs?
Since I recently started learning and using C I wanted to improve my workflow with C since I'm used to rust. 

Now what do I exactly mean by this? Rust has a lot of features directly included like e.g. hashmaps, vectors and so on. 

And since C doesn't really have any of these I thought of implementing them myself as a good introduction to general memory management and development in C.

#### Where can I find the documentation?
If you are actually willing to use these libraries then the documentation can be found [here](https://penguins-organization-2.gitbook.io/c-libs)
